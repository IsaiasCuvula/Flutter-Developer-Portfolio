# Billiffy - Expense tracker app (4,8 ⭐️ - 1k downloads)

Introducing Billify my first Flutter App on the App Store & Google Play Store! - the ultimate bill reminder app. I created it with the goal of making it a part of daily routine. My aim was to make the app visually stunning yet practical, using unique icons that are easy to understand.

I integrated Firebase for seamless synchronization across multiple devices. Reminders are crucial for any good bill tracking app, which is why I added local and push notifications. Shortcuts make it quick and easy to add new bills.

Billify offers multiple currencies, categories, and filtering options, including upcoming, paid, and overdue bills. You can add, update, or delete bills and view them in a calendar with category colors. Reports are available in different chart types and currencies, with options for annual, monthly, weekly, and daily filtering. Choose your preferred chart type and currency in the settings.

With Billify, you'll never miss a bill again.

# Quote Generator 

This project was a lot of fun to work on! Initially, I set out to create a simple quote generator app using Flutter. But I added more features and functionality that I realized could be helpful to others as well. The app consists of a clean and intuitive interface where users can create quotes, mark them as favorites, download them as images, copy the quote text to the clipboard, customize the text style and background color, and share them with other users or on social media. What I enjoyed most about developing this app was finding ways to balance Flutter's various widgets and animations to create a seamless user experience. Additionally, the project helped me learn something new about Flutter every day as I researched ways to improve the app's functionality and design.
