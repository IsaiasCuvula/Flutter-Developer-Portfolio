# Quote Generator 

This project was a lot of fun to work on! Initially, I set out to create a simple quote generator app using Flutter. But I added more features and functionality that I realized could be helpful to others as well. The app consists of a clean and intuitive interface where users can create quotes and share them on social media. What I enjoyed most about developing this app was finding ways to balance Flutter's various widgets and animations to create a seamless user experience. Additionally, the project helped me learn something new about Flutter every day as I researched ways to improve the app's functionality and design.
